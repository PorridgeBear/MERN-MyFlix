# MERN MyFlix

I've used this project as a dual-pronged refresher and learning project for the popular MERN technology stack.

Netflix is my feature set inspiration as it covers a broad range of common requirements found in web applications:

* Responsive, reactive UI
* Content navigation, filtering, searching
* User authentication and authorisation
* Account management
* Admin CRUD
* Data storage
* Caching
* Media handling (upload, streaming, thumbnailing) and CDN usage

# Architecture

The project employs API-driven frontend architecture.

* Frontend: React single page app (SPA); for users of MyFlix, including an "admin" context that will enable CRUD
* API: Node/Express; provisioning features via API for the frontend

Since the project is in the first instance to refresh/learn some MERN, I have avoided microservice architecture, though a fork of this project to break the monolithic API into services may be a nice follow-on project.

# Approach

## Story mapping

I'll be taking a look at Netflix and deciding which features I will implement (and which I won't) for this project using the release planning approach called Story Mapping. 

## Data modelling

I like to think about the data model early on, and will create a rough entity relationship diagram (ERD) for what I think will underpin all features.

## Iterations

I'll then get into a rhythm of implementing deliverable iterations following the Story map.
